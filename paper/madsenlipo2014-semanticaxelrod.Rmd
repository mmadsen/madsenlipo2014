# Introduction

Although humans and our hominid ancestors have been cultural animals
throughout our evolutionary history, an important change occurred in our
lineage during the Middle and Upper Paleolithic. After many millennia
with varied but relatively small toolkits, and material culture which
was very similar across continental distances, our cultural repertoire
began to explode. The artifactual toolkit became larger and its
constituent tools and technologies more complex, the range of materials
used to construct it was enriched, and our solutions to the problems of
everyday life became regionalized and differentiated. Further, the
economic basis of our lives began to broaden and also, in many areas, to
become specialized [@bar2002upper;@d2011evolution;@guy2005mosaic].  


Careful examination of the Middle Paleolithic archaeological record,
especially in Africa and the Near East, suggests that this change in
behavior was not a sharp "revolution," and that much of the enriched
material culture we later characterize as the "Upper Paleolithic" had
precursors in many areas. These were patchy, both in space and time
[@bouzouggar200782;@d2007additional;@d2011evolution;@guy2005mosaic;@mcbrearty2000revolution;@mcbrearty2007down].
Nevertheless, even if our understanding of the time scale over which this enrichment  occurred has lengthened and the spatial scope has
widened, the evolution of "behavioral modernity" remains a central puzzle in the evolution of our species.  

The most promising explanations of behavioral modernity are those which examine
the nature of cultural variation and social learning itself, how these might have varied over time and across populations, and the factors which shaped fitness landscapes for middle and upper Paleolithic hominins.  Our own belief is that some variant of the "learning hypothesis" [@Nishiaki2013Introduction], broadly construed, will yield the best explanations for what amounts to a "phase transition" in the nature of human cultural capacities and material culture.   

The simplest models have tended to explore the consequences for cultural transmission of various factors exogeneous to social learning itself.  Perhaps the most significant debate has occurred around the role of population size in determining diversity.   Shennan [-@shennan2000population;-@shennan2001demography] proposed that
demography has a powerful effect on diversity within cultural transmission processes, and 
this seems to be supported by the reduced cultural diversity
and loss of toolkit elements observed in Tasmania during a
population bottleneck
[@henrich2004].  Kuhn [-@Kuhn2013Cultural-Transm] argues that low population size and density put Neanderthals in a situation where innovations spread slowly and ultimately led to their demise relative to modern humans.  Furthermore, a growing set of experimental studies clearly show a relationship between accumulation of complex cultural traits and the number of cultural "models" from whom individuals can learn [@muthukrishna2014sociality; @derex2013experimental; @kempe2014experimental].  Collard and colleagues, on the other hand, question whether population size has any real-world effects on toolkit diversity, as a result of a series of comparative studies on a wide range of hunter-gatherer groups which show no association [@collard2011drives; @collard2013population; @collard2013risk; @collard2013plos].  Finally, in his analysis of the overall evolutionary rate, Aoki [-@Aoki2013Determinants-of] found that innovation rates were more important than population size to determining the rate of evolution in a population.  

To us, this body of work appears to indicate that while population size is an important parameter in our mathematical models, it is a second-order effect in the real world, interacting with a myriad of other factors and thus often dominated by those factors.  One such factor is the structure of bands or demes into larger
regional metapopulations.  Everything we know about 
the strong effect that network topology has upon contagion or diffusion processes [e.g., @castellano2009statistical; @smilkov2012influence] suggests that regional structure has critical effects on the outcomes we can expect from a single social "learning rule."  Along these lines, Premo [-@premo2012local] has examined whether metapopulation dynamics, with
local extinction and recolonization, might account for the retention and
expansion of diversity, with promising results. 

A foundational event in human evolution like behavioral modernity is
highly unlikely to have a single cause, even within the broad umbrella of cultural transmission theory and the learning hypothesis.  Instead, we
should expect a combination of factors.  The way in which individuals learn skills and information likely plays a central role, as emphasized in the "learning hypothesis" analyzed from many angles in this series [@Aoki2013Determinants-of; @Nishiaki2013Introduction].  For example, Sharon [-@sharon2009acheulian] suggested
that Middle Paleolithic populations might have been characterized by
strongly conformist learning, which lessened over time, leading to a
dramatic increase in cultural diversity.  We know that learning and teaching styles vary across human groups, and formal modeling efforts are beginning to make clear that such variation has evolutionary consequences that might lead to a rapid expansion of the human cultural repertoire [@Nakahashi2013Cultural-Evolut].  Those populations which increased the amount or effectiveness of teaching would have a fitness advantage over those who relied upon imitation and "natural pedagogy" in passing along technological and foraging knowledge [@Csibra:2011dx; @Fogarty:2011gv; @Terashima2013The-Evolutionar].  Demography and population structure play important roles in reinforcing the fitness differences which different learning strategies would create, as pointed out by Kuhn [-@Kuhn2013Cultural-Transm].  Sterelny [-@sterelny2012evolved, p.61] sums up this combination of factors nicely:

> ...the cultural learning characteristic of the Upper Paleolithic
> transition and later periods of human culture—social transmission with
> both a large bandwidth and sufficient accuracy for incremental
> improvement—requires individual cognitive adaptations for cultural
> learning, highly structured learning environments, and population
> structures that both buffer existing resources effectively and support
> enough specialization to generate a supply of innovation.

Creanza and colleagues [-@Creanza2013Exploring-Cultu], Aoki [-@Aoki2013Determinants-of], and Nakahashi [-@Nakahashi2013Cultural-Evolut] develop models which examine the conditions under which teaching (as opposed to simple imitation) affects the overall evolutionary rate or cultural diversity in a population, providing a formal basis for exploring Sterelny's explanatory sketch.  In an important sense, however, these models are "thin" descriptions, providing us an understanding of the effects of teaching _in general_ within a social learning system.  Such models are critical, but we need to complement them with "thicker" models which can describe how the structure and even content of cultural knowledge evolves given social learning processes, the scaffolding provided by teaching and technological infrastructure, and the developmental process by which people learn necessary skills and information [@wimsatt2014].  

Towards this end, in this chapter we suggest that the size and structure of artifact design spaces and fidelity of the learning environment have a strong effect upon the cumulative richness and complexity of toolkits and technology.  To formalize this idea, we construct a model which:

* Represents cultural traits as hierarchically structured, in order to study increases in complexity
* Has a learning rule sensitive to the order in which cultural traits are acquired, with multiple levels of fidelity
* Has a mechanism (such as homophily) which allows cultural differentiation endogeneous to the model

As the "learning environment" in such models is tuned from lower to higher fidelity, 
we would expect to see greater diversity, larger structured sets of traits persisting in the population, and greater differentiation of the population into "different" cultural configurations.  We also expect that individual innovation, independent of the social learning context, will play a role in the accumulation of cultural complexity by allowing a population to explore increasingly large spaces of technological design possibilities; this expectation is concordant with Aoki's [-@Aoki2013Determinants-of] result in Volume I of this series.

In this chapter, we introduce a simulation model which combines a hierarchical
trait space capable of expressing the "semantics" of relationships
between skills and information [@Mesoudi2008a], and a modified version
of Robert Axelrod's [-@axelrod1997] homophilic social learning model
which allows us to examine the conditions under which evolution in a hierarchical design space leads to cultural differentiation. After describing 
the model, we study its dynamics and provide an initial assessment of its suitability
for studying the onset of behavioral modernity in the later Paleolithic.  Models like this begin
to move beyond diffusion dynamics, bringing the actual meaning and
relations of traits into the modeling process. Hence we call these
"semantic Axelrod" models, and believe that such models form a platform
for formalizing the type of multi-factor hypotheses necessary to examine
major transitions in human evolution, such as "behavioral modernity."  

# The Semantic Axelrod Model for Trait Prerequisites 

Much of our technical knowledge, whether of stone tool manufacture, throwing clay pots, or computer repair, is built from simple tasks, bits of background knowledge, and step-by-step procedures [@neff1992ceramics; @schiffer1987theory].  We organize our knowledge and skills in many ways, but it is common to think of a complex process as a "script" or "recipe" [@schank1977scripts].  Of course, experts in a task or field may not see it this way, having internalized such structures below the conscious level.  Experts will often know more than one way to accomplish any given goal, and be able to repurpose and recombine methods and tools, as opposed to the simpler, more linear or tree-based recipes of the novice or student. [e.g., @Bleed:2008in;@bleed2002obviously;@stout2002skill].  

A formal model of the relations between components in a technology, or the knowledge necessary to execute a technological recipe, will involve many kinds of relationships.  Some items will be related in time, as steps in a process.  Others will be related by subsumption:  arrowheads are a subclass of bifacial stone tools, and require many of the same production techniques as bifaces used in other projectiles.  Still others will be related as sets of alternatives:  choices of surface treatment for a given ceramic paste, given the firing regime selected, for example.  To date, most archaeological models of tool production have focused upon temporal relationships, as in "sequence models" or "$\textrm{cha\^ine op\'eratoire}$," but many representations are possible, including trees and more general graphs to capture multiple types of relations
[@Bamforth:2008kq;@Bleed:2008in;@Ferguson:2008ce;@Hogberg:2008fj;@bleed2001trees;@bleed2002obviously;@schiffer1987theory;@stout2002skill]. 

In this chapter, we focus not on the execution steps of a recipe (and thus not on sequence models), but the relations between skills and information _as it is learned_.  In other words, we focus upon the _prerequisite_ relationships that exist between cultural traits, since the ordered dependencies between skills and information form one of the structures within social learning occurs during development (and into adulthood).  Some pieces of information or skills must be in place before a person can effectively learn or practice others.  Examples from our own childhoods abound:  one needed to understand addition and subtraction and multiplication before learning long division; in order to make  soup, we need to understand how to simmer rather than boil, how to chop and slice, what ingredients might be combined, and so on.  The fact that knowledge and skills build upon one another make prerequisite relations between cultural traits ubiquitous.  Incorporating such relations into social learning models is thus a useful first step in developing a slightly "thicker" description of cultural transmission.  In this chapter, we represent prerequisite relations as trees in the graph-theoretic sense [@diestel2010graph], replacing the "nominal scale" structure of "locus/allele" models or paradigmatic classifications and some typologies [@Dunnell1971], but we emphasize that the tree models we discuss here are still classifications and thus analytic tools, designed to allow us to measure variation in the archaeological record, not reconstruct emic models of Paleolithic technologies.    

Our model also requires a way of representing a changing learning environment, in ways that create higher fidelity and greater possibility for building cumulative knowledge.  In real learning environments, there are many possibilities, but deliberate teaching and apprentice learning are repeatedly seen across human groups as ways that naive individuals can reliably learn the complex skills and information needed for foraging, artifact production and maintenance, and navigating an increasingly rich social world.  The point of structuring the learning environment with teaching and/or apprenticeship is to 
give the learner skilled models to imitate, shortcut trial and error when acquiring a skill, 
provide a reference for needed information, and to guide individuals to put their information and
skills together into appropriate sequences to accomplish an overall goal.  Apprenticeship and formalized teaching provide a social learning "scaffold," helping to lower the amount of individual trial and error learning needed to master a body of material [@wimsatt2007reproducing; @wimsatt2007re].  

Within a standard discrete-time simulation model of a social learning process, we can model this type of learning environment with the following modifications:

1.  Represent the order in which skills and information need to be acquired as a series of trees, with vertices representing traits (either a skill or piece of information), and edges the prerequisite relations between them.
2.  Disallowing individuals the ability to copy traits from a cultural model for which they do not have necessary background or prerequisites, given the relations in the applicable tree model.
3.  Creating a probability that individuals, if disallowed a trait, can be taught one of the needed prerequisites instead by that cultural model, leading to the potential accumulation of fuller knowledge and skills over time.

By changing the probability that individuals learn a missing prerequisite trait, we can "tune" the learning environment.  Low probabilities might correspond, for example, to a learning environment where individuals can observe others executing a production step, but are given little or no instruction or guidance on what they need to know in order to successfully master it.  High probabilities of learning prerequisites would correspond, on the other hand, to environments where individuals receive instruction, or work together with a more skilled individual who guides them toward learning the information and skills they lack.  In the next section, we discuss the implementation of both points in more detail.


## Representation of Traits And Their Prerequisites

In order to represent the "prerequisite" relations between a number of
cultural traits, we organize the traits into trees[^tree], where nodes higher
in the tree represent knowledge, skills, or concepts which are necessary
for traits further down the tree.  Let us consider the different skills and information
necessary for the construction of a single artifact, say a dart thrown by an atlatl.  An artisan will possess information about different raw materials, an understanding of what materials are suitable for specific purposes, skills and information concerning the knapping of different types of bifaces, methods of hafting bifaces into different kinds of shafts, and so on.  Stout [-@stout2011stone] organized such knowledge into "action hierarchies," which represent sequences of actions, sets of choices, and optional elements for the construction of a class of stone tools.  Action trees, drawn from Moore's [-@moore2010grammars] graphical notation, represent the relations present in execution of a technical process. 

\begin{figure}[h] 
\centering 
\includegraphics[]{balanced-trait-tree-3-3.png} 
\caption{A single trait tree, represented by a balanced tree with branching factor 3 and depth factor 3, order 40.  In our model, nodes higher in the tree represent prerequisites for nodes lower down the tree.  Each instance of the model will have several or many of these trees in the design space.} 
\label{img:trait-tree} 
\end{figure}  

Here, we are interested in the order in which people usually _learn_ skills and information, rather than the order in which steps are executed.  The difference is potentially significant, in that two adjacent steps in a sequence might involve very different information, tools, or skills, which can be learned in parallel without dependencies.  Because, in our model, traits cannot be learned unless an individual possesses the necessary prerequisites, we introduce the idea of a "learning hierarchy," which is a division of Stout's action hierarchy into components which are learned with ordered dependencies, and independent components represented in separate trees. For example, one might 
learn about the sources of good lithic raw materials, independent of learning how to perform different percussion techniques.

\begin{figure}[h] 
\centering 
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{design-space-4-trees.pdf} 
\caption{A design space composed of 4 independent trees, each tree with branching factor 3 and depth factor 3, order 40.  We also studied larger design spaces with 16 independent trees, and with larger branching and depth factors.} 
\label{img:design-space-4} 
\end{figure} 

In each simulation model, we begin with a trait or "design space" that incorporates several independent sets of traits [@o2010cultural].  The overall design space of a simulation model is thus a forest[^forest], composed of several trees (Figure \ref{img:design-space-4}).  For each tree in a learning hierarchy, we employ balanced trees which have the same number of nodes at each level, to provide a simplified model of a design space with which to begin our exploration of this class of social learning model, although real design spaces are undoubtedly more complex in their geometry.  Each tree in our model is specified by  a branching factor $r$ and depth $h$. As a result, each trait tree in
the design space has $\sum_{i=0}^{h} r^i$ traits. 

The tree depicted in Figure \ref{img:trait-tree} thus has 40 vertices, for example.  In this chapter, we examine both small (4 trees) and larger (16 trees) design spaces, to see how learning may differ in problems involving design spaces of different size and complexity.  We examine trees with combinations of branching and depth factors of 3 and 5.  Thus, a design space with 4 trees with branching and depth factors of 3 (as in Figure \ref{img:trait-tree}) would have 160 traits, whereas a design space with 16 trees of branching and depth factors of 5 would have a total of 62,496 traits.[^limits]  Even the small design spaces we consider here create a large space for cultural change and differentiation, given the number of possible trees one can construct on even 40 vertices.[^2] 

Given the total "design space" represented by a forest of trait trees, each individual in our
model is initialized with a small number of "initial" traits.  Initial traits are chosen randomly but 
heavily weighted towards the roots of the trees to represent the fact that our knowledge starts out
basic and sparse.  In the next sections we describe the social learning model, modified from Robert Axelrod's original, by which each simulated population evolves within this tree-structured design space, and will return to the specifics of how an initial culture repertoire is chosen.

## The Axelrod Model of Social Learning and Differentiation

Robert Axelrod [-@axelrod1997] formulated a model aimed at studying the conditions
under which simple learning rules could lead to cultural differentiation, 
rather than a single fixed state (which is the result of simpler neutral or 
diffusion models).  This makes it useful as a starting point for understanding phenomena 
such as behavioral modernity, in our view.  Axelrod's
model combines social learning, in the form of random copying, a spatial
structure to interaction, in the form of localized copying of neighbors
on a lattice, and the tendency to interact most strongly with those to
whom we are already culturally similar (homophily). The model displays a
rich and interesting set of behaviors, and has been extensively studied
by social scientists and physicists [@castellano2009statistical]. First we 
review the basic model, and in the following section our modified algorithm.

### Axelrod's Original Model

The original model locates $N$ individuals on the nodes of a 
regular lattice or grid, but various network structures have also been studied. Each individual is endowed
with $F$ integer variables $(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_F)$, that can each
assume $q$ values. In the original model, each variable is a "cultural
feature" each of which can assume $q$ "traits." In each step, a randomly chosen individual $i$ and a
random neighbor $j$ are selected, and "interact" with probability equal
to the overlap between their cultural repertoire. Overlap, in the basic
model, is simply the fraction of features for which $i$ and $j$ possess
the same trait value:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:axelrod}p(i,j) = \frac{1}{F} \sum_{f=1}^{F} \delta_{\sigma_f(i)\sigma_f(j)}\end{equation}

where $\delta_{i,j}$ is Kronecker's delta function, taking the value $1$
when its two arguments are equal and $0$ otherwise. When individuals
interact, the focal individual $i$ takes the trait value of its neighbor
for one of the features where the two individuals differ.

Interaction has no
effect when two individuals already possess identical cultural
repertoires, and there is no probability of interaction if individuals
have no traits in common. This eventually causes the model
to reach an absorbing state where no further changes are possible.
Instances of the model are initialized with a random distribution of
traits among individuals, and left to update until the steady state is
reached. The evolution of the population leads to two classes of
absorbing states: (a) a "monocultural" state in which all individuals
share the same set of variables, and (b) a "polycultural" state in which
subpopulations exist which share the same set of variables within the
group, and are completely different from their neighbors.

Which of the two results is reached, and the statistical character of
"polycultural" states when they exist, depends mainly upon the number of
traits possible $q$ for each cultural feature. For small values of $q$,
individuals share many traits with their neighbors, interactions are
thus frequent, and one domain comprising a single set of traits will
grow to become fixed within the entire population. In contrast, when the
value of $q$ is high, individuals start out sharing very few traits,
with interactions that are correspondingly less frequent. Regions of
uniform cultural variation do grow, but as they do, sets of individuals
who share no traits at all (and thus do not interaction) grow as well,
and often prevent any single regional culture from expanding to fix
within the population.

Many variants of the basic Axelrod model have been studied, including
the addition of "drift" via the introduction of copying error, situating
agents on different types of complex networks, the addition of an
external "field" to simulate the effects of mass media, and copying that
obeys a "conformist" or majoritarian rule by selecting the most common
trait among the neighbor set
[@castellano2000nonequilibrium;@de2009effects;@flache2006sustains;@GonzalezAvella:2007p6910;@GonzalezAvella:2007p6912;@gonzalez2005nonequilibrium;@gonzalez2006local;@Klemm:2003p7031;@Klemm:2003p7112;@Klemm:2005tb;@Lanchier:2010p16999;@Lanchier:2012ur].
In general, modifications of the basic model can reduce the tendency of
the model to produce polycultural solutions, or change the time scale or
location of the critical point. 

### Semantic Extensions to the Axelrod Model

We begin each simulation with $N$ (100, 225, or 400) agents, arranged on a
square grid.  A design space is created, with some number of trait trees (4 or 16), with uniform branching factors and depth factors (3 or 5).  An example of such a tree is shown in panel A of Figure \ref{img:prereq}.
Initial traits (and their prerequisites) are chosen randomly
across the configured number of trait trees, as follows.  For each individual, we select a random number $t$ between 1 and 4, and repeat the trait selection process $t$ times for that individual.  In each selection, we choose a random tree in the design space, and then select a depth in the tree for the trait, given by $d  \sim \textrm{Poisson}(0.5)$.  This biases trait selection towards the root of the tree, as one would expect in young or inexperienced individuals.  We then walk $d$ steps into the tree, making uniform random selections for the children of each vertex.  The path of vertices thus constructed is added to the individual's trait set, giving them an initial trait and its necessary prerequisites.  One such initial trait is shown in Panel B of Figure \ref{img:prereq}.  Given that individuals begin with a small number of initial traits (between 1 and 4, selected randomly), and their prerequisites, the initial trait endowment of an individual is between 1 and $4h$, where $h$ is the maximum depth of the design space (either 3 or 5 in the experiments reported here).[^median] 

\begin{figure}[htbp] 
\centering 
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{design-init-final.pdf} 
\caption{Illustration of a design space composed of a single trait tree, along with a random initial trait chosen from the design space, and a final sample from a simulation run, showing the evolution of traits within the design space.  Also shown in the top panel are the ``prerequisites'' for a cultural trait (35), as an example.} 
\label{img:prereq} 
\end{figure} 

Once the population is initialized, the simulation runs a discrete approximation to a continuous-time model.  In other words, only one agent changes at each elemental time step, as in the original Axelrod model and the Moran model of population genetics and its cultural version [@aoki2011rates; @moran1962statistical; @moran1958random].  At each step, an agent (A) is chosen at random, and a random neighbor of A is then selected (agent B).  Their probability of interaction is given by the overlap of trait sets, which is most simply calculated as the Jaccard overlap between the set of tree vertices each possesses, thus replacing Equation \ref{eq:axelrod} with:

\begin{equation}J(A,B) = \frac{|A \cup B| - |A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}\end{equation} 


If the agents end up interacting, agent A observes the traits currently possessed by B, and selects a trait (T) that it does not already possess to learn.  If agent A has the necessary prerequisite traits for the selected trait, it can learn trait T.  If not, there is a probability $\mathbb{P}(l)$ that B can teach A a necessary prerequisite for T instead.  This simulates the process of agent B structuring the learning environment of A through formal instruction or apprenticeship, for example.  If such a prerequisite learning event occurs given $\mathbb{P}(l)$, agent A learns the most fundamental of T's prerequisites that it does not already possess.  For example, agent A might require the trait
closest to T (e.g., trait 11 in Figure \ref{img:prereq}, if the original trait targeted was 35).  

Additionally, at each time step, there is a probability $\mathbb{P}(m)$ that one random individual in the population
will learn a new trait (and necessary prerequisites) that it does not already
possess.  For example, if an innovation event occurs and an agent discovers trait 35 by individual trial and error learning, we assume that the agent also discovered traits 0, 3, and 11.  Thus innovation can introduce one trait to the population, or a linked set depending upon its prerequisites and what the innovating individual already "knows."  This model of innovation simulates an  ongoing process of individual learning unconnected to social learning
within the population.  Because this 
functions much like "infinite-alleles mutation" in the classical Wright-Fisher neutral models [@Ewens2004],
or like noise terms in Axelrod, Ising, or Potts models [@castellano2009statistical], we will refer to this as the "global innovation rate" in this chapter.

Each simulation run lasts 10 million steps, which is an average of 100,000 copying events
per individual (in a population of 100).[^time]  Samples are taken beginning at 6 million steps, and sampling at an interval of 1 million steps, and record the trait trees seen in the population.  An example of such a sampled tree is shown in Panel C of Figure \ref{img:prereq}.  For reference, the full algorithm for each copying step is 
given in the Appendix as Algorithm \ref{alg:tree-prereq-axelrod}.

# Measuring Cultural Diversity and the Results of Structured Learning #

Each sample from a simulation run is composed of the distinct sets of trait trees possessed by individuals in the population, along with summary statistics.  If a simulation run converges to a monocultural solution, the sample will have one set of trait trees, which are shared across the entire population.  In other cases, there will be multiple cultural configurations or "regions," which might be unique to a single individual, or shared by some number of agents.  Each region will be composed of some number of trait trees (typically, the number configured for the simulation run:  4 or 16, but perhaps a subset), and each trait tree will be the result of many agents learning traits and their prerequisites socially, and for runs with a non-zero mutation rate, by individual learning or innovation.  Each culture region will thus have some number of traits, typically higher (often much higher) than the initial endowment given to the population.  

\begin{figure}[htbp] 
\centering 
\includegraphics[]{equil-trait-tree.png} 
\caption{An example set of traits at the conclusion of a simulation run, extracted from a simulation with branching factor 3 and depth factor 3, and a single trait tree as the trait space.  The remaining density of vertices, mean vertex degree, and radius of the tree are noted.  Vertex colors denote ``structural equivalence'' classes or ``orbit structure,'' as measured by adjacency patterns, and is one measure of the symmetries present in the tree.} 
\label{img:final-tree} 
\end{figure} 

Samples contain descriptive statistics for the trait trees of each cultural region, as follows.  The ratio of the number of traits in the sample to the full design space size (or "remaining density" of traits) is a measure of how diverse a cultural region is.  The radius of a rooted tree is the number of edges in the path from root to the furthest edge.  The average radius of trees in a sample (or its ratio to the depth of the design space) is a measure of how diverse and "deep" a cultural configuration is.  Similarly, in the original design space, the branching factor describes how many children each node in the tree started with, so measuring the average vertex degree gives us a rough measure of how diverse the cultural configuration is (in terms of breadth).  Each of these measures is illustrated in Figure \ref{img:final-tree} for an example tree selected from our data.  


In addition to these simple numerical measures comparing final trees to
the original design space, it is useful to measure something about the overall "shape" of
the trees themselves.  One way of formalizing this notion is to examine the
_symmetries_ of the final trait trees. Examining Figure \ref{img:final-tree}, if we ignore
the exact identities of traits for the moment, it is apparent that there are repeating patterns. 
For example, the left-most branches each terminate in a pair of leaves.  This pattern is repated on 
the second right-most branch.  These types of repeating patterns are computationally 
expensive to search for in large sets of trees, but we can summarize them by considering trait
trees as algebraic objects and examining their _automorphisms_.  

An automorphism is a function which maps an object to itself, in such a way that the structure of the 
object is preserved [@rotman1995introduction].  Graph automorphisms map vertices in a graph to each other, preserving properties such as the adjacency pattern of edges.  The six vertices which mark the repeating pattern of leaf-pairs in Figure \ref{img:final-tree} are an automorphism of the tree, and thus are symmetries we can measure.  An overall measure of "how symmetrical" (or "how many interchangeable patterns") there are in a graph possesses given by the total number of automorphisms found, called the size of the automorphism group or $|\textit{Aut}(G)|$  [@godsil2001algebraic].  A tree with no 
repeating patterns will thus have an automorphism group size of 1, indicating that the only symmetry is the entire tree itself.  A balanced tree with branching and depth factors of 3, as depicted in 
Figure \ref{img:trait-tree}, has approximately $1.3 \times 10^{10}$ automorphisms.  The more repeating patterns there are in trait trees, the more automorphisms they will possess.  

Because group sizes grow quickly and the accuracy of performing calculations with truly astronomical numbers is low, another possible measure of the symmetries present is to count the _classes_ of equivalences into which vertices fall.  The _orbits_ of the automorphism group are the sets of vertices which are interchangable by some permutation that preserves structure.  For example, the graph in Figure \ref{img:trait-tree} has five orbits, with each vertex at a given level interchangable (in a structural sense).  Similarly, the six leaf vertices that are part of pairs in Figure \ref{img:final-tree} are part of the same orbit; in this illustration, each orbit is given a different color to highlight their equivalence. 
For each cultural region found when sampling a simulation, we calculate the size of the automorphism group and the number and multiplicity (frequency) of orbits.  For this analysis, we employ the _nauty + Traces_ software by
Brendan McKay and Adolfo Piperno [@McKay201494].[^4]  


# Experiments

For this chapter, we examined populations of size 100, 225 and 400, to begin to examine the effects of population size.  For these populations, we examined design spaces that were small (4 trait trees) and large (16 trait trees).  Within each size, we further examined combinations of branching factor and depth factor with values of 3 and 5, thus yielding 8 total sizes of design space (Table \ref{tab:axelrod-design-space-size}).

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}

\end{table}

Further, we examined three levels of global mutation or innovation rate:  zero, or no mutation, and 0.00005 and 0.0001.  Such rates created a constant supply of new innovations, but several orders of magnitude less frequent than copying and prerequisite learning events.  The full set of parameters are given in Table \ref{tab:axelrodct-sim-parameters}.  For each combination of all of the above parameters, we performed 25 replications.  With 5 samples per simulation run, this yielded 10,963,691 samples of cultural regions.

\end{table}

The simulations were designed to examine whether the combination of a hierarchical, tree-like representation of cultural traits, in combination with an Axelrod-like model which provides the possibility of cultural differentiation, is a good platform for exploring questions surrounding behavioral modernity.  We are not experts concerning Paleolithic assemblages, so our efforts are exploratory, and an attempt to construct models which can be extended and applied to real data.  

In analyzing the results of the semantic Axelrod model described here, we looked at the degree to which individuals converged in their cultural repertoire (as we might describe conditions in the early Paleolithic), or under what conditions did social learning lead to greater individual variation in repertoires?  This is measured by the number of cultural regions in samples of the population taken at quasi-stationary equilibrium.   

Second, we looked at whether highly structured learning environments, represented here by higher probabilities of naive individuals gaining the prerequisites for the skills and information they encounter with peers, led to deeper and richer cultural repertoires.  We also began examining whether there are invariant statistical properties of those repertoires, through the use of symmetry measures.  The measures used are those described above:  the tree radius (or depth), mean vertex degree, the fraction of remaining vertices, and the size of the automorphism group of sampled trait forests.  Finally, we began to examine how the structured learning environment might interact with demography, by simulating the same parameters across two sizes of population. 


# Results

We begin by noting that compared to the original Axelrod model, or neutral and biased copying models, the dynamics of our semantic axelrod model are highly variable.  A very wide range of outcomes is possible for each parameter combination, especially when the size of the design space is large.  Some variables, such as the average vertex degree of sampled trait trees, strongly overlap across all learning rates and are not considered further in this chapter.  Given the large amount of variability in the dynamics, larger numbers of replications would be useful, although this is computationally quite expensive at present.[^expense]  That said, several features of the data are strongly suggestive that hierarchical trait models have potential in modeling cumulative technological evolution, making the computational expense worthwhile.

## Cultural Diversity ##

Variation among individuals is foundational to evolutionary processes, and is the raw material from which differentiation between regions and cultural groups is constructed.  In the simulations reported here, we examine diversity within a single population, but we are planning a set of metapopulation experiments with the same model to address regional diversification.  In Figure \ref{img:size-spectrum-cultures-100} we show the size spectrum of cultural regions (clusters of individuals with the same trait trees), for each combination of prerequisite learning rate and design space size.  The variable plotted here is the number of cultural regions in a given sample.  Thus, in a population of size 100, if there is 1 cultural solution, then all 100 individuals share it.  If there are 100 cultural regions, then every individual had a unique configuration of cultural traits.  In the lower left corner are the very lowest learning rates, in small design spaces.  We believe this could correspond to the kind of learning environments and knowledge structures that characterizes human technology through much of the early and middle Paleolithic.  In this corner, most cultural regions span the entire population (given the large spike on the left).  In small design spaces, configurations become more diverse and smaller on average, as the learning rate increases.  As it becomes highly probable that an individual will learn the prerequisites they need for an encountered skill or trait, the population fragments among different portions of the design space. 

\begin{figure}[htbp] 
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{size-spectrum-regions-saa12full.pdf}
	\caption{The sizes of cultural configurations, by the size of the design space (horizontal), and prerequisite learning rate (vertical), for population size 100.}
	\label{img:size-spectrum-cultures-100}
\end{figure}


Two other effects are also visible in these data.  First, the distributions become bimodal for most combinations of design space size and learning rate.  The left hand peak corresponds to simulation runs which had no global innovation or mutation rate, and where only copying and prerequisite learning occurred.  In such populations, cultural regions were uniformly large and populations quickly converged on a single set of traits.  This highlights the importance of various "innovation" and "invention" processes in the creation and maintenance of cultural differentiation and diversity [@eerkens2005cultural; @o2010innovation], and suggests that systematic change in innovation processes may be a crucial component of any multi-factor model for the evolution of behaviorial modernity.  The second effect is the distinctive narrowing of the size distribution in the largest design spaces and highest learning rates.  This is not an artifact of the length of time into the simulation run a sample was taken, since the distributions look identical for samples taken at 1 million step intervals.  This is likely just the signature of a small population evolving in a very large design space.  This effect warrants further study, since it may be a source for group divergence as information and technology accumulates in human societies.  


## Trait Richness and Knowledge Depth ##

\begin{figure}[h] 
\centering 
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{mean-radius-by-learning-rate-innov-12.pdf} 
\caption{Mean depth of trait sets, by prerequisite learning rate and global innovation rate, for population size 100.} 
\label{img:mean-radius-cultures-100} 
\end{figure} 

Cumulative evolution of technology is represented in our model by the population learning its way _down_ the trees which compose the design space.  Possession of traits deeper in the trees represents skills or information which is more specific, possessing more prerequisites.  Thus, we expect that the depth (or "radius", see Figure \ref{img:final-tree}) of trees would increase with the prerequisite learning rate, representing a learning environment which is structured to ensure such acquisition.   

Figure \ref{img:mean-radius-cultures-100} gives the _normalized_ mean radius of cultural regions, broken out by the prerequisite learning rate along the horizontal axis, and each group of 3 boxplots displays the differing global innovation rates studied.  Radii are normalized to the depth of their design space, to facilitate comparison.  The results indicate that essentially two regimes exist:  shorter trees, which do not grow much beyond their initialized size, and larger trees.  The mean radius has an asymptote just above 0.75, achieved with the prerequisite learning rate is approximately 0.4 or higher.  Further increases do not seem to matter.  Additionally, the difference between the two global innovation rates is small--what matters most in terms of qualitative behavior is the presence of global innovation outside the teaching or learning of prerequisites themselves.  



## Population Size ##

Earlier, we mentioned that population size does not seem to be a primary factor in explaining the measured diversity in cultural transmission models, except perhaps in bottleneck situations like the one Henrich analyzes in Tasmania [-@henrich2004].  Instead, population size may have an interaction effect with other factors, yielding smaller second-order effects.  We examined the effect of population size in the research reported here, repeating the entire set of simulation runs for populations of 100, 225, and 400.[^budget]  

\begin{figure}[h] 
\centering 
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{mean-radius-by-learning-rate-pop.pdf} 
\caption{Mean depth of trait sets, by prerequisite learning rate and population sizes of 100, 225 and 400.} 
\label{img:mean-radius-cultures-pop} 
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{img:mean-radius-cultures-pop} displays the relationship between mean radius (or depth) of the cultural traits in each cultural sample, as in Figure \ref{img:mean-radius-cultures-100} above, but the boxplots are instead colored by population size.  There is no qualitative difference in the dynamics as population size grows, but the mean radius of trait sets does decline slightly, probably due to the slower velocity at which an innovation diffuses in the larger population.  This is the kind of second-order effect which warrants continuing to include population size in analyses of social learning models, we believe, even if it does not serve as a primary explanation or factor.  



## Trait Tree Symmetries ##

Finally, we examined the algebraic properties of the trait trees composing cultural regions, examining both the number of vertex equivalence classes (orbits) and the size of the automorphism group of the trait forests.  We examined the raw metrics, and versions normalized by the size of the maximally symmetric forest with the same number of traits, branching factor, and depth factor.  The latter proved difficult and led to serious overflow problems even with 64 bit arithmetic, so we focus here on the raw automorphism group size.  

\begin{figure}[h] 
\centering 
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{autgroupsize-by-learning-by-innovation.pdf} 
\caption{Number of symmetries in trait tree samples, measured as the log of the order of the automorphism group of the trait graphs, broken down by prerequisite learning rate and global innovation rate.} 
\label{img:autgsize} 
\end{figure} 

The logarithm of the automorphism group size does hint at interesting structure (Figure 
\ref{img:autgsize}).  In the presence of mutation, the learning of prerequisites narrows the range of variability for the automorphism group size, and at higher learning rates renders the distribution multimodal.  The modality arises because of the different combinations of branching factor and depth factor we employed for design spaces--i.e., some design spaces are "wide" and some are "narrow," while also being "shallow" or "deep."  This gives rise to different modes in the measured symmetries, but overall the reduction in variability in symmetry is the most important qualitative effect seen in our data.

We do not fully understand the "shapes" of cultural regions to which the model appears to converge, but it appears that there is a tendency for trait graphs to converge towards shapes which have moderate numbers of symmetries.  This graph is on a logarithmic scale, so a peak at 50 along the horizontal axis correponds to a trait graph with approximately $5 \times 10^{21}$ symmetries.  This is a fairly small number, compared to the original design spaces, which have symmetries ranging from approximately $10^{41}$ to $10^{6496}$.  Thus, the geometry of cultural traits in our hierarchical design spaces are fairly asymmetric and represent small and very specific segments of the total design space.  

Further analysis of trait graph "shapes" is needed to tell whether there are repeating patterns or graph "motifs" which characterize a social learning model in a graph-structured trait space.  The results here are suggestive of such a phenomenon, but inconclusive given just the bulk algebraic properties of cultural regions, since the size of the automorphism group (or the number of orbits) tells only _how many_ symmetries there are, not what types of symmetries exist.  The next step in our analysis of shape is to pursue a geometric decomposition of the graph following Ben MacArthur and $\textrm{Rub\'en S\'anchez-Garc\'ia's}$  [-@macarthur2008symmetry] work on the symmetries of complex networks.

# Discussion

The "semantic Axelrod" model described here specifically addresses social learning of knowledge with "prerequisite" structure, and a learning environment which is tunable from low to high fidelity.  We introduced this model as a multifactor explanation for the transition in the structure of social learning that may have occurred in early _Homo sapiens_ and which has often been called the "Upper Paleolithic Transition" or more neutrally, "behavioral modernity."

The model displays a characteristic increase in the cultural repertoires of individuals, as they learn in environments of higher fidelity.  Individuals will tend to learn along "pathways" governed by the knowledge of their models, elders, and peers, instead of the "random cultural samples" they receive in a low-fidelity random copying process.  At the individual level, an increase in higher fidelity learning within structured information environments both creates path-dependency in what is learned, and increases the chances for specialization among individuals.  At the group and regional scale, we expect that a metapopulation version of this model will display regional-scale differences in cultural repertoires which become the seeds for the persistent regional differences which characterize the later Pleistocene and Holocene archaeological records.  

The model described here only makes a start on modeling the additive and recombinative complexity of real technologies, but it does display accumulated depth of "knowledge" or "skills," as represented by the radius or depth of trait trees.  In combination with realistic models of technology--such as the production sequences studied by experts on stone tools--we believe that empirically sufficient models of the evolution of specific technologies are possible and within reach.  

Several areas suggest themselves for future research in structured information or "semantic" cultural transmission models. Some we are pursuing, others remain open questions and we invite collaboration towards their solution.  

* Regional scale cultural differentiation given a metapopulation embedding of the basic model.
* Additional trait relations (e.g., class subsumption, functional equivalencies).
* Realistic technology models for key artifact classes (e.g., bifaces, scrapers, pottery).
* Incorporation of trait fitness in order to study directional change.  

We believe that models of the class studied here are a promising platform for studying social learning of realistic technologies in structured learning contexts where ordered acquisition of skills and information are important.  Such models are "thicker" descriptions of how humans acquire skills and information in real learning environments, and thus complement existing models which describe the conditions under which teaching and structured learning might evolve and spread.  We believe models of this type are necessary to formalize evolutionary explanations for complex, multifactor phenomena such as behavioral modernity, and also make a needed "downpayment" on cultural transmission models which can meaningfully interface with archaeometry, the technnological analysis of lithics and pottery [@tostevin2012seeing], and studies of how innovation occurs in various tool classes [e.g., @o2010innovation].

## Algorithm Description

Algorithm \ref{alg:tree-prereq-axelrod} describes the ``semantic'' Axelrod model variant studied in this chapter.  Within the algorithm, there are several functions which find traits with particular properties.  Some, like \textbf{GetTraitUniquetoFocal()}, are fairly simple set operations but were abbreviated to clarify the notation. 

\begin{algorithm}[H]

	\end{algorithmic}
	\end{boxedminipage}
\end{algorithm} 

\textbf{GetDeepestMissingPrerequisite()} is a procedure which takes the trait set of an individual, and a trait for which the individual is known to be missing necessary prerequisites, and returns the ``most basic'' missing prerequisite for that trait (i.e., closest to the root). This is done by finding the path which connects the root and desired trait, and walking its vertices from the root downward, checking to see if each vertex is part of the individual's trait set.  The first trait not found in the individual's repertoire is returned.  


## Availability of Software and Analysis Code

The software used in this chapter is available under an open-source
license at Mark Madsen's GitHub repository
<https://github.com/mmadsen/axelrod-ct>. Required libraries and software
are listed in the source archive itself, and include Python 2.7 and the
open-source MongoDB database engine to store simulation output.

The codebase consists of a set of library modules which implement the
shared and unique aspects of each model, unit tests to verify the basic
functionality of the code, and scripts which execute each model. The
**axelrod-ct** repository contains three models:

-   An implementation of the original Axelrod model using the
    **axelrod-ct** libraries.

-   A basic model with an "extensible" trait space but no relations
    between traits.

-   A "semantic" Axelrod model with tree-structured trait space
    representing prerequisite relationships between traits.

Stepwise extension from the original Axelrod to the semantic models on the same code library allowed a
degree of verification, which is difficult in a situation where there is
no existing mathematical theory against which to compare the code
implementation [@national2012Assessing].

The analysis and final dataset reported here are available, along with
the source of this paper and associated presentations, in an associated
GitHub repository: <https://github.com/mmadsen/madsenlipo2014>. Statistical
analyses of the final dataset were performed in R, employing Knitr to render our results easily reproducible given simulation output [@xie2013dynamic].  


[^2]: If we consider each trait to be unique and non-interchangeable,
    the number of unique trees with unique vertex labels is $n^{n-2}$ by
    Cayley's theorem [@diestel2010graph]. For example, for each trait
    tree of 40 vertices, there are roughly $10^{60}$ possible trees.
    Even if we consider traits to be interchangeable (e.g., we look at
    the abstract topology of trees rather than the details of individual
    traits), there are *at least* $10^{16}$ possible unlabelled rooted
    trees on 40 vertices (using Otter's [-@otter1948number]
    approximation).



[^4]: Nauty+Traces can be downloaded at
    <http://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/>. We employed version 2.5r7 for this
    research.

[^tree]:  A tree is a graph with no cycles or loops.  That is, a tree is a connected graph on $n$ vertices that possesses at most $n-1$ edges [@diestel2010graph].  Furthermore, in this chapter we are concerned with _rooted_ trees, in which one vertex is distinguished as the "origin" of the tree, giving rise to a hierarchical structure.  

[^forest]: A forest is a graph composed of multiple components, each of which is a tree.  

[^limits]: We initially chose 6 as the limit on branching and depth factors, but found that we cannot calculate certain symmetric statistics, such as the size of the automorphism group, on trees that large using existing tools.  Even a tree with $r=5, h=6$ has over $10^{1623}$ possible symmetries, and calculating that number takes over 100 seconds on a fast multi-core computer.  

[^time]:  100,000 was chosen as a compromise for running large batches of simulations in parallel.  Some simulation runs, especially in small design spaces with very high prerequisite learning rates, can converge to a monocultural solution and quasi-stable equilibrium quite quickly; in the largest design spaces and low learning rates, convergence may never occur even though the process is well-mixed.  However, the processes have reached a quasi-stable equilibrium, verified by examining samples at different times for secular trends in median and mean values, which were not found.

[^median]:  The median number of traits in samples taken after 6-10 million time steps is considerably higher--259 traits per cultural configuration or region.  Thus, cultural repertoires grow significantly over time, as expected.  

[^expense]:  The simulations reported here ran on a cluster of 6 compute-optimized "extra large" Linux instances on Amazon's EC2 computing cloud, for a total of 17 days of wall clock time and 2075 CPU hours.  We plan further optimizations to the simulation code to make larger samples economically feasible.  

[^budget]:  We should note that learning rates of 0.8 and 0.9 for population size 400 were cut short due to budget constraints, but this does not appear to affect the pattern in our dataset.  


[^geertz]: Wimsatt [-@wimsatt2014] notes that studies of cultural transmission tend either to be "long on Geertzian thick description" but short on quantitative predictions and measurements that allow hypotheses to be tested, or formalized mathematical models which are thin on the contextual detail that real social learning entails.
