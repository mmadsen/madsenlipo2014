# Introduction

Although humans and our hominid ancestors have been cultural animals
throughout our evolutionary history, an important change occurred in our
lineage during the Middle and Upper Paleolithic. After many millennia
with varied but relatively small toolkits, and material culture which
was very similar across continental distances, our cultural repertoire
began to explode. The artifactual toolkit became larger and its
constituent tools and technologies more complex, the range of materials
used to construct it was enriched, and our solutions to the problems of
everyday life became regionalized and differentiated. Further, the
economic basis of our lives began to broaden and also, in many areas, to
become specialized [@bar2002upper][@d2011evolution][@guy2005mosaic] This
transition has long been called the "Upper Paleolithic Revolution," or
less humbly, even the "Human Revolution."

Careful examination of the Middle Paleolithic archaeological record,
especially in Africa and the Near East, suggests that this change in
behavior was not a sharp "revolution," and that much of the enriched
material culture we later characterize as the "Upper Paleolithic" had
precursors in many areas. Their appearance was patchy, and did not
persist long
[@bouzouggar200782][@d2007additional][@d2011evolution][@guy2005mosaic]
[@mcbrearty2000revolution][@mcbrearty2007down].
Nevertheless, if the time scale over which this permanent enrichment of
human material culture occurred has lengthened and the spatial scope has
widened, it remains a central puzzle in the evolution of our species.
Innovation and differentation became hallmarks of what we now think of
as "human culture," and intergenerational social learning became highly
cumulative in two senses: greater fidelity of learning led to reliable
retention of beneficial skills and information, and we began to
elaborate and tinker with previous knowledge, producing new forms from
existing ones.

Explanations for behavioral modernity in the late Pleistocene are many,
and our purpose here is not to review them . However, we see no evidence
that ancestral sapiens was biologically incapable of rich, cumulative
culture, and indeed the better we understand the Middle Paleolithic in
Asia and Africa, the more we see evidence for complex toolkits and
personal adornment, even if these are patchy and often do not persist.
Among explanations which do not focus upon biological capabilities or
species differences, those with the most potential, we believe, address
the process by which cultural information itself is passed on and
modified.

Among explanations that relate to cultural transmission, demography has
been suggested as an important factor, since reduced cultural diversity
and loss of toolkit elements have been documented in Tasmania during a
population bottleneck
[@henrich2004][@shennan2000population][@shennan2001demography]. But a
recent comparative study shows that population size itself is only
weakly associated (if at all) with toolkit diversity (except possibly
during bottlenecks). The structure of bands or demes into larger
regional metapopulations also has strong effects. Premo
[@premo2012local] has examined whether metapopulation dynamics, with
local extinction and recolonization, might account for the retention and
expansion of diversity, with promising results. Finally, the way social
learning occurs within a population can radically change its
quantitative results over time. Sharon [@sharon2009acheulian] suggested
that Middle Paleolithic populations might have been characterized by
strongly conformist learning, which changed over time, leading to a
dramatic increase in cultural diversity.

A foundational aspects of human behavior like "behavioral modernity" is
highly unlikely to have a single cause, especially if it evolved over
many tens of millennia in a widely distributed popuulation. Instead, we
should expect a rich, multi-factor narrative. Demography, and the
metapopulation dynamics of individual demes or groups, likely played
roles. Changes in the way individuals learned skills and information
likely played important roles. The evolution of cooperation and
pro-social behaviors are probably implicated, as well. Sterelny
[@sterelny2012evolved] sums up the multi-factor view nicely:

> ...the cultural learning characteristic of the Upper Paleolithic
> transition and later periods of human culture—social transmission with
> both a large bandwidth and sufficient accuracy for incremental
> improvement—requires individual cognitive adaptations for cultural
> learning, highly structured learning environments, and population
> structures that both buffer existing resources effectively and support
> enough specialization to generate a supply of innovation.

Bringing this kind of explanation into formalized, testable form
requires the construction of models. In addition to existing models
which address the effects of population size and metapopulation
structure on the results of cumulative cultural transmission, we need to
understand how the nature of the social learning process itself might
have changed.  By themselves, none of the above factors describe
the increasing tendency for tools and technologies to be the cumulative,
composite result of earlier, simpler components in the Upper Paleolithic
and more recent archaeological records.  What we require is a social learning model 
in which traits are not merely tokens or markers, but can build upon one another.

To that end, we have constructed a model which combines a hierarchical
trait space capable of expressing the "semantics" of relationships
between skills and information [@Mesoudi2008a], and a modified version
of Robert Axelrod's [@axelrod1997] homophilic social learning model
which allows us to examine how different learning rates affect the resulting
sets of cultural traits.  Models like this begin
to move beyond diffusion dynamics, bringing the actual meaning and
relations of traits into the modeling process. Hence we call these
"semantic Axelrod" models, and believe that such models form a platform
for formalizing the type of multi-factor hypotheses necessary to examine
major transitions in human evolution, such as "behavioral modernity." In
this chapter, we describe the structure of our initial semantic Axelrod
model, and initial results on analysis of its behavior across a range of
learning rates.

# The Semantic Axelrod Model for Trait Prerequisites 

In what way might the learning environment change, to create greater fidelity of transmission, 
and cumulative addition and recombination of variation to create more complex and composite tools?
There are many possibilities, but deliberate teaching, and apprentice learning are ways in which the learning environment can be 
structured and the acquisition of important skills and prerequisite knowledge "scaffolded" [@wimsatt2007reproducing; @wimsatt2007re]. 
The point of structuring the learning environment with teaching and/or apprenticeship is to 
give the learner skilled models to imitate, shortcut trial and error when learning a skill, 
provide a reference for needed information, and to guide individuals to put their information and
skills together into appropriate sequences to accomplish an overall goal.  Much of our technical knowledge and skills are 
built recursively from simpler elements.  We can bundle both needed skills and necessary background 
knowledge into the term "prerequisites" for modeling purposes.  In this chapter, we model 
social and individual learning where the information learned has a clear "prerequisite" structure. 

Given a realistic but abstract model of cultural traits and their prerequisites, we ask whether increasing the fidelity with which individuals can learn the prerequisites of traits they observe in the population leads to more diverse and deep sets of knowledge after many cycles of social learning.  In the next sections, we describe the trait representation, social learning rules, and methods of analyzing trait structures in detail.  

## Representation of Traits And Their Prerequisites

In order to represent the "prerequisite" relations between a number of
cultural traits, we organize the traits into trees, where nodes higher
in the tree represent knowledge, skills, or concepts which are necessary
for traits further down the tree.  If we consider the different skills and information
necessary for the construction of a single artifact, say a dart thrown by an atlatl, it's 
clear that there are sets of skills and information relating to the selection of raw materials 
for the projectile point, relating to knapping different types of bifaces, methods of hafting bifaces
into different kinds of shafts, and so on.  We model such examples as a number of different trees, 
or as a "forest" of trees [^forest].

\begin{figure}[htbp] 
\centering 
\includegraphics[]{images/balanced-trait-tree-3-3.png} 
\caption{A single trait tree, represented by a balanced tree with branching factor 3 and depth factor 3, order 40.  In our model, nodes higher in the tree represent prerequisites for nodes lower down the tree.} 
\label{img:trait-tree} 
\end{figure} 

Specifically, we model the design space as $T$ independent trees, each
tree possessing a branching factor $r$ and depth $h$. Each trait tree in
a forest has $\sum_{i=0}^{h} r^i$ traits in each of $T$ trees, and represents a set of traits
which all have prerequisites stemming from that "root" prerequisite. 
The tree depicted in Figure \ref{img:trait-tree} thus has 40 vertices, and a design space
with 4 such trees would have 160 possible traits. Even such a relatively
small space of traits creates a vast number of possible cultural
configurations.[^2]  

Given the total "design space" represented by a forest of trait trees, each individual in our
model is initialized with a small number of "initial" traits.  Initial traits are chosen randomly but 
heavily weighted towards the roots of the trees (using a Poisson random variable with $\lambda = 0.5$ to select the "depth" of an initial trait), to represent the fact that our knowledge starts out
basic and sparse.

\end{figure} 








## The Axelrod Model of Cultural Differentiation




Most of the cultural transmission models employed in archaeological
research to date have been directly derived from, or inspired by, the
classic models of theoretical population genetics. Key examples include
neutral models describing both drift in small populations, and the
diffusion of cultural traits with no apparent fitness differentials
(i.e., "stylistic" types) [@Neiman1995], and models of conformist bias
derived from Boyd and Richerson's [@BR1985] pioneering work. Such models
are excellent for studying certain classes of behavior, such as the
quasi-stationary distribution of traits given loss to drift and addition
via mutation, or the average amount of time for a new innovation to be
lost to drift in a fixed-size population. One thing that is difficult to
systematically study with such models, however, is the formation of
distinct cultural groups, given that pure diffusion models converge to a
single equilibrium state (or stationary distribution of states).

Robert Axelrod [@axelrod1997] formulated a model aimed at studying the
balance between "local convergence" and "global polarization." Axelrod's
model combines social influence, in the form of random copying, spatial
structure to interaction, in the form of localized copying of neighbors
on a lattice, and the tendency to interact most strongly with those to
whom we are already culturally similar (homophily). The model displays a
rich and interesting set of behaviors, and has been extensively studied
by social scientists and physicists [@castellano2009statistical]. In the
remainder of this section, we describe the model in formal detail,
prepatory to describing our modifications to add trait systems which are
structured in ways analogous to real knowledge and skills.

The basic Axelrod model locates $N$ individuals on the nodes of a graph.
In its most basic form, the agent graph is formed by the sites of a
regular lattice or grid, but various structures have been studied,
including graphs with the so-called "small world" property which
characterizes most social networks (Figure ). Each individual is endowed
with $F$ integer variables $(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_F)$, that can each
assume $q$ values. In the original model, each variable is a "cultural
feature" each of which can assume $q$ "traits." In archaeological
parlance, the cultural variation is divided into $F$ dimensions with $q$
attributes, yielding $F^q$ classes which can describe a cultural
configuration. In each step, a randomly chosen individual $i$ and a
random neighbor $j$ are selected, and "interact" with probability equal
to the overlap between their cultural repertoire. Overlap, in the basic
model, is simply the fraction of features for which $i$ and $j$ possess
the same trait value:

where $\delta_{i,j}$ is Kronecker's delta function, taking the value $1$
when its two arguments are equal and $0$ otherwise. When individuals
interact, the focal individual $i$ takes the trait value of its neighbor
for one of the features where the two individuals differ.[^1] The full
algorithm for the original Axelrod model is given in Algorithm .

It is evident that pairs of individuals are more likely to interact and
thus "learn" cultural traits from one another when they already share a
substantial fraction of their cultural repertoire. Interaction has no
effect when two individuals already possess identical cultural
repertoires, and there is no probability of interaction if individuals
have no traits in common. This last feature eventually causes the model
to reach an absorbing state where no further changes are possible.
Instances of the model are initialized with a random distribution of
traits among individuals, and left to update until the steady state is
reached. The evolution of the population leads to two classes of
absorbing states: (a) a "monocultural" state in which all individuals
share the same set of variables, and (b) a "polycultural" state in which
subpopulations exist which share the same set of variables within the
group, and are completely different from their neighbors.

Which of the two results is reached, and the statistical character of
"polycultural" states when they exist, depends mainly upon the number of
traits possible $q$ for each cultural feature. For small values of $q$,
individuals share many traits with their neighbors, interactions are
thus frequent, and one domain comprising a single set of traits will
grow to become fixed within the entire population. In contrast, when the
value of $q$ is high, individuals start out sharing very few traits,
with interactions that are correspondingly less frequent. Regions of
uniform cultural variation do grow, but as they do, sets of individuals
who share no traits at all (and thus do not interaction) grow as well,
and often prevent any single regional culture from expanding to fix
within the population.

The Axelrod model is often studied as an example of a system with phase
transitions -- sudden changes in the behavior of a system as the value
of a parameter crosses a threshold. It turns out that the "monocultural
state" occurs whenever $q < q_c$, the latter being a "critical value,"
which depends upon the value of $F$, and regional differentiation of
cultures becomes more frequent and more fragmented as $q > q_c$.
Physicists studying the Axelrod model focus on two empirical
observables: (a) the average size of the largest cultural region in a
polyculture, and (b) the number of cultural regions in a polycultural
state.

Many variants of the basic Axelrod model have been studied, including
the addition of "drift" via the introduction of copying error, situating
agents on different types of complex networks, the addition of an
external "field" to simulate the effects of mass media, and copying that
obeys a "conformist" or majoritarian rule by selecting the most common
trait among the neighbor set
[@castellano2000nonequilibrium][@de2009effects][@flache2006sustains][@GonzalezAvella:2007p6910][@GonzalezAvella:2007p6912][@gonzalez2005nonequilibrium][@gonzalez2006local][@Klemm:2003p7031][@Klemm:2003p7112][@Klemm:2005tb][@Lanchier:2010p16999][@Lanchier:2012ur].
In general, modifications of the basic model can reduce the tendency of
the model to produce polycultural solutions, or change the time scale or
location of the critical point. To date, though, Axelrod models have not
been modified to introduce structure to the traits themselves.



We introduce a simple extension of Axelrod's model in which traits can
have a variety of relations which then affect the basic copying rule. An
example of such relationships would be "prerequisites," in which
comprehension of a concept or mastery of a skill requires prior skills
and knowledge. Another key example are steps in the construction of a
complex artifact, which are related in a sequence but are often learned
separately, especially by novices
[@Bamforth:2008kq][@Bleed:2008in][@Ferguson:2008ce][@Hogberg:2008fj][@bleed2001trees][@bleed2002obviously][@schiffer1987theory][@stout2002skill].
A set of structured relations between traits can be represented as a
graph, with vertices representing traits, edges the relations between
them, and the graph as a whole composing the "design space" of possible
phenotypes [@o2010cultural]. Simple relations between traits,
representing perhaps production sequences or knowledge prerequisites,
require only a single class of edge and can be represented as simple
graphs or even trees (that is, a connected graph with no cycles)
[@diestel2010graph]. More complex situations may require more than one
edge between vertices, leading to trait spaces which are *multigraphs*.

Hereafter, we refer to Axelrod-style models with homophilic copying
rules but graph-structured trait spaces as "semantic" Axelrod models. In
such models we also relax the restriction that individuals have a fixed
number of traits in their cultural repertoire. This is essential if
individuals are to "learn" knowledge or skills in ways that are governed
by the structure of the trait space and their interactions. In models
where agents may possess an unlimited number of traits, and traits are
not assigned to dimensions or "loci," the Axelrod copying rule is
modified such that the probability of interaction between two agents is
given by the overlap of their trait sets, which is simply the Jaccard
coefficient:

where $A$ and $B$ are the sets containing the traits held by two
individuals.

## A Simple Model of Knowledge and Skill Prerequisites


In this paper we examine whether homophilic copying governed by the
prerequisite structure of cultural knowledge, combined with individual
learning of prerequisites, leads to a consistent "shape" or topology for
the traits held by individuals. For examples, when do individuals tend
to end up with a breadth of knowledge or skills within a given area
(i.e., root), as opposed to having specialized but not broad skills?

We begin each simulation with $N$ (usually 100) agents, arranged on a
square grid, each initialized with $t_{init}$ traits (where $t_{init}$
is a uniform random variable between 1 and a maximum value for that
simulation run). Traits (and their prerequisites) are chosen randomly
from the configured number of trait trees, but biased towards the root
of each trait tree, to simulate individuals starting with only "basic"
knowledge, and learning over time through trial and error and cultural
transmission.

At each time step, two neighboring agents are chosen at random, and
their probability of interaction is calculated as the Jaccard
coefficient of their trait sets. If the agents interact, the focal agent
randomly selects a trait from the neighbor which it does not already
possess. If the focal agent has the necessary prerequisites for the
desired trait, it can learn the trait and add it to its repertoire. If
not, it cannot immediately learn the trait, but there is a probability
(a parameter of the simulation run) it can learn a needed prerequisite
from the neighbor instead. Figure illustrates the needed prerequisites
(green vertices) for a randomly chosen leaf trait (in red).
Additionally, at each time step, there is a probability that a random
agent will lose an existing trait (through forgetting or disuse), or
learn a new trait through individual learning that it does not already
possess. The full simulation rule algorithm is given as Algorithm , and
the range of parameter values studied is given in Table .

As in the original Axelrod model, the simulation proceeds until there
are no neighboring pairs with a positive probability of interacting. At
this point, the population should be at a mono- or polycultural
equilibrium, with a cluster or cluster of agents who all possess the
same trait trees. Our analysis of the model focuses upon these "final"
trait trees, their shape and topology, and what fraction of the total
design space they represent.

## Measuring Trait Tree Variation

At the conclusion of each simulation run, each cultural configuration
(one, in a monocultural equilibrium, more in a polycultural solution) is
composed of some number of trait trees, up to the original number $T$
configured for a simulation run. We analyzed how each trait tree in a
solution compares to the full design space by measuring the mean
remaining density of vertices (compared to the original), mean vertex
degree, and mean radius.[^3]

\begin{figure}[htbp] 
\centering 
\includegraphics[]{images/equil-trait-tree.png} 
\caption{An example set of traits at the conclusion of a simulation run, extracted from a simulation with branching factor 3 and depth factor 3, and a single trait tree as the trait space.  The remaining density of vertices, mean vertex degree, and radius of the tree are noted.  Vertex colors denote ``structural equivalence'' classes or ``orbit structure,'' as measured by adjacency patterns, and is one measure of the symmetries present in the tree.} 
\label{img:final-tree} 
\end{figure} 

In addition to these simple numerical measures comparing final trees to
the original design space, we want to measure the "shape" of the trees
themselves. One way of formalizing this notion is to examine the
*symmetries* of the final trait trees. Examining Figure , if we ignore
the exact identities of traits for the moment, it is apparent that the
traits at each "level" are structurally interchangeable. They possess
the same number of parent connections (1), and the same number of
children (either 3 or 0). Compare this with Figure . The latter is much
more asymmetric than the original trait tree, but yet there are still
repeating patterns, such as the three sets of doublets in the bottom
row.

The set of symmetries of a trait tree ($t$) are those permutations which
preserve the adjacency pattern of edges in the tree, or in other words
preserve vertex degree. The set of all such symmetries is called the
*automorphism group* of the graph $\textit{Aut}(G)$
[@godsil2001algebraic]. We can measure the number of possible
permutations by the number of elements of the automorphism group, since
a maximally asymmetric graph will have only the identity in
$\textit{Aut}(G)$ and thus a group size of 1, whereas the complete graph
$K_{10}$ has $n!$ possible symmetries, or
$|\,\textit{Aut}(K_{10})\,| = \num{3628800}$.

Because group sizes have the potential to be extremely large in graphs
of even moderate order (e.g.,
$|\,\textit{Aut}(K_{341})\,| \approx 10^{717}$), another approach is to
count the *orbits* of trait trees. The orbits of the automorphism group
for a graph define a set of equivalence classes for vertices. Two
vertices which are in the same orbit share the same adjacency pattern
and are thus interchangeable in terms of the graph structure. As an
example, the graph in Figure has 5 orbits, corresponding to the vertices
at each level in the graph. In this analysis, we employ the software by
Brendan McKay and Adolfo Piperno [@McKay201494].[^4]

(NOTE: Here we should translate the hypotheses from the start of the
paper into expectations for the trait tree metrics....)

## Reproducible Analysis

The software used in this chapter is available under an open-source
license at Mark Madsen's GitHub repository
<https://github.com/mmadsen/axelrod-ct>. Required libraries and software
are listed in the source archive itself, and include Python 2.7 and the
open-source MongoDB database engine to store simulation output.

The codebase consists of a set of library modules which implement the
shared and unique aspects of each model, unit tests to verify the basic
functionality of the code, and scripts which execute each model. The
**axelrod-ct** repository contains three models:

-   An implementation of the original Axelrod model using the
    **axelrod-ct** libraries.

-   A basic model with an "extensible" trait space but no relations
    between traits.

-   A "semantic" Axelrod model with tree-structured trait space
    representing prerequisite relationships between traits.

Stepwise construction of the models on the same code libraries allowed a
degree of verification, which is difficult in a situation where there is
no existing mathematical theory against which to compare the code
implementation [@national2012Assessing].

The analysis and final dataset reported here are available, along with
the source of this paper and associated presentations, in an associated
GitHub repository: <https://github.com/mmadsen/axelrod-ct>. Statistical
analyses of the final dataset were performed in R, embedded in the
source version of the paper, which uses Knitr[^Knitr] and produces multiple
output formats, including LaTeX for publication.

[^1]: This feature is chosen with uniform probability when more than one
    feature differs between individuals $i$ and $j$.

[^2]: If we consider each trait to be unique and non-interchangeable,
    the number of unique trees with unique vertex labels is $n^{n-2}$ by
    Cayley's theorem [@diestel2010graph]. For example, for each trait
    tree of 40 vertices, there are roughly $10^{60}$ possible trees.
    Even if we consider traits to be interchangeable (e.g., we look at
    the abstract topology of trees rather than the details of individual
    traits), there are *at least* $10^{16}$ possible unlabelled rooted
    trees on 40 vertices (using Otter's [@otter1948number]
    approximation).

[^3]: The radius of a rooted tree is simply the number of edges
    traversed between the root and the most distant leaf. In this case,
    the radius of a trait tree will be less than or equal to its
    original depth factor, and the ratio of the two is an indicator of
    how much trait trees include more specialized, as opposed to more
    generalized or prerequisite, traits.
