\abstract*{Cultural transmission models are coming to the fore in explaining increases in the Paleolithic toolkit richness and diversity. During the later Paleolithic, technologies increase not only in terms of diversity but also in their complexity and interdependence. As \citet{Mesoudi2008a} have shown, selection broadly favors social learning of information that is hierarchical and structured.  We believe that teaching provides the necessary scaffolding for transmission of more complex cultural traits.  Here, we introduce an extension of the Axelrod \citeyearpar{axelrod1997} model of cultural differentiation in which traits have prerequisite relationships, and where social learning is dependent upon the ordering of those prerequisites. We examine the resulting structure of cultural repertoires as learning environments range from largely unstructured imitation, to structured teaching of necessary prerequisites, and we find that in combination with individual learning and innovation, high probabilities of teaching prerequisites leads to richer cultural repertoires.  Our results point to ways in which we can build more comprehensive explanations of the archaeological record of the Paleolithic as well as other cases of technological change.}
